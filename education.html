                    My journey in higher education led me to pursue a Diploma in Information Technology 
                    from a prestigious institution. This comprehensive program equipped me with hands-on 
                    knowledge in web development, database management, and software engineering principles. 
                    Through intensive coursework and practical projects, I gained proficiency in multiple 
                    programming languages and frameworks. The program emphasized both theoretical concepts 
                    and real-world applications, enabling me to work on meaningful projects that enhanced 
                    my problem-solving abilities and technical skills.

                    My secondary education was completed at a high school specializing in multimedia production and basic coding.
                    I gained foundational knowledge in digital media, including video and audio production, graphic design, and content creation while also learning core coding concepts. The curriculum combined classroom theory with hands-on lab sessions where I used editing software, multimedia hardware, and wrote simple programs and scripts. 
                    This practical, developed my technical skills and gave me a strong foundation for further studies in information technology, preparing me well for my diploma program.

                    My primary education began at a local elementary school in Seremban, where I developed 
                    a strong foundation in basic academic subjects. During these formative years, 
                    The school emphasized both academic excellence and character development, 
                    fostering values such as discipline, teamwork, and curiosity. These six years laid the 
                    groundwork for my educational journey and helped shape my passion for learning and 
                    exploration.
